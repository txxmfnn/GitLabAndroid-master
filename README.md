## Building

To build the project create a file called 'signing.gradle' in the 'app' directory. It should contain your signing information as below.

```
android {
    signingConfigs { 
        release {
            storeFile file("..")
            storePassword ".."
            keyAlias ".."
            keyPassword ".."
        }
    }
}
```

Then execute 'gradlew assembleRelease' in the project's root directory. If everthing went fine, the APK file can be found in 'pathtoproject/app/build/outputs/apk'
